# Security Documentation

## Authentication System

This application implements a secure authentication system with multiple layers of protection.

### Credentials
- **Username**: `dessar`
- **Password**: `azumi2024`

### Security Features

#### 1. Input Sanitization
- Removes potentially dangerous characters (`<>\"'%;()&+`)
- Prevents script injection
- Removes event handlers
- Limits input length to 50 characters

#### 2. Rate Limiting
- Maximum 3 failed attempts
- 5-minute lockout period after max attempts
- Automatic reset after lockout period

#### 3. Session Management
- Secure session tokens using crypto.getRandomValues()
- Session timeout: 30 minutes
- Dual storage: sessionStorage + localStorage with expiration
- Automatic session validation

#### 4. Input Validation
- Username: 3-50 characters, alphanumeric + underscore only
- Password: 6-50 characters
- Real-time validation with error messages

#### 5. Timing Attack Prevention
- Random delay (1-2 seconds) on authentication attempts
- Consistent response times regardless of success/failure

#### 6. XSS Protection
- Input sanitization
- Content Security Policy headers
- XSS protection headers

#### 7. CSRF Protection
- Session-based authentication
- Secure session tokens
- Same-origin policy enforcement

### Server-Level Security (.htaccess)

#### 1. File Access Control
- Blocks access to sensitive files (auth.js, config files)
- Prevents access to backup files
- Hides hidden files

#### 2. Security Headers
- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Content-Security-Policy

#### 3. Rate Limiting
- DOS protection with mod_evasive
- Request limiting per IP

### Usage

#### Login Process
1. User enters credentials
2. Input is sanitized and validated
3. Rate limiting is checked
4. Authentication attempt with timing protection
5. Session is created on success
6. User is redirected to protected content

#### Session Management
- Sessions are automatically validated on page load
- Expired sessions trigger automatic logout
- Users can logout manually with Ctrl+Shift+L

#### Protection Levels
1. **Client-side**: Input validation, rate limiting, session management
2. **Server-side**: File access control, security headers
3. **Network-level**: HTTPS (recommended for production)

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers
- Never store credentials in plain text (use hashing in production)
- Implement proper server-side validation
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regular security audits
- Keep dependencies updated

#### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Logout when finished
- Don't share credentials
- Clear browser data if using shared computers

### Production Recommendations

1. **Server-side Authentication**: Move to proper backend with database
2. **Password Hashing**: Use bcrypt or similar
3. **HTTPS**: Enable SSL/TLS encryption
4. **Database Security**: Use parameterized queries
5. **Logging**: Implement security event logging
6. **Monitoring**: Set up intrusion detection

### Known Limitations

1. **Client-side Only**: This is a demo implementation
2. **Plain Text Storage**: Credentials are stored in plain text
3. **No Database**: No persistent user management
4. **Single User**: Only supports one set of credentials

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:
1. Do not disclose publicly
2. Contact the development team
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes

**Note**: This is a demonstration system. For production use, implement proper server-side authentication with database storage and HTTPS encryption.
